			<h4>If you've answered yes or no to these questions, then PatriotCare (PCare), is the MLM/Healthcare provide you need!</h4>
			<p> PCare was created by Americans who have insurance for Americans who need insurance. This core idea drives PCare to provide the "standard" in healthcare while also providing a very competitive MLM oppertunity. When you use your insurance, your premiums are used as for PCare's marketing budget. More visits to the hospital have never been more profitable!</p>
